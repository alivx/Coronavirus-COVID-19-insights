### Coronavirus COVID-19 statistical analysis playground

This is a sample statistical dataset I created using pandas.
I merged multi dataset together in order to get meaningful statistical data, I plaining to add more different data set and merge it with this pandas data frame to get more deep info it may help us to get a better understanding of that virus behaviour.

What I need to achieve with those datasets:
1. Climate factor in the virus spreading behaviour.
2. Economical factor in the virus spreading behaviour.
3. Tourism factors.
4. ...etc
Anything I can join the data together may help us to see in different sight.

##### Notes:

I will try to update csv data in daily bases.

#### How to use.
1. First install the python packages by `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.A. Use the jupyter `jupyter notebook`
2.B or run the python script `python COVID-19.py`

You can use the output to visual the data.

Output files:
* covid019.csv # CSV file
* covid019.xlsx # Excel file
* COVID-19.db # SQLite3 file
